Hashing
Hash Function
Collision Resolving
  Seperate Chaining
  Open Addressing uses probing

    Linear probing
    . Easy implement
    . Best Cache Performance
    . Suffers from clustering

    Quadratic probing
    . Average cache Performance
    . Suffers a lesser clustering

    Double Hashing
    . Poor cache Performance
    . No clustering
    . Requires more computation time
